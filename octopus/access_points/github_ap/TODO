1) connect emails in commits dir to the user requested
   - found some script /github_ap/scripts/github_email.sh but its really bad 
2) on master or other say at commit X branch B was cloned
 - started in github_api.py saving the branches in aggregated dict data members. 

3) add to meta branches_names,branch create date(?)
